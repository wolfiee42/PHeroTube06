        <p class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Q. Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</p>
        <p> <span class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-500">Ans:</span> <span class="text-lg font-medium">var has function-level scope and can lead to unintended global variable pollution due to hoisting.
                let and const have block-level scope, offering better scoping control, with let allowing variable
                reassignment and const preventing it while permitting modifications to object properties or array
                elements. In modern JavaScript, it is recommended to use let and const for clearer and safer variable
                scoping.</span></p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Q. Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</p>
        <p> <span class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-500">Ans:</span> <span class="text-lg font-medium">
                null represents the intentional absence of any object value and is often used when a variable should
                have no meaningful value or to reset object references. undefined typically indicates an unintentional
                absence of a value, often the initial state of a variable, or when a function doesn't return a
                value.</span></p>

        <p class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Q. What do you mean by REST API?</p>
        <p> <span class="text-xl font-semibold text-green-500">Ans:</span> <span class="text-lg font-medium">A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of
                rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It relies on standard HTTP methods
                (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources represented as URLs. REST APIs follow a
                stateless client-server architecture, enabling scalable, loosely coupled, and platform-agnostic
                communication between software applications over the internet. They are commonly used for data
                retrieval, creation, update, and deletion in web and mobile applications.</span></p>
